# PROJETO-DA-FACULDADE-1
In this repository that is still in progress, I am developing software for a real client denture lab in Project Analysis I. I am developing the front end and the back end.
It is noteworthy that this project is underway. According to teacher deliveries, I will update the repository. Upon final delivery, I will make the software documentation available.
